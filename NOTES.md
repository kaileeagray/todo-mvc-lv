### Lecture notes

1. integrate basic theme. this is a stylized app, so get the asset pipeline set up first

think about narrative of app:
2. Users create lists. Add item to those lists. Navigate many lists and see each list items.

** look at the nouns to find models **
THINK OF BASE TO START. don't worry about users, extra to start.

## lists
  has many items

## items
  belongs to a list

3. ^^ don't worry about models yet. CRUD lists (create, retrieve, update, delete)

  + create a list
  + see all their lists
  + show a list

- just get started on this
