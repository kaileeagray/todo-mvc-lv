OAUTH2 Flow
## bash variables exist for one execution -- use figoro or dotenv
1. user goes to /auth/github
2. omniauth redirects to github -- providing github with key and secret
    identifying my application. lets github know which of the applications that use
    Github the user is trying to log into
3. user logs in with GitHub
4. github redirects them back to my application (callback URL)
    provides app with a secret code that reps user
    ** does not have user data -- just secret code
5. app sends secret code back to github
6. github confirms code came from github and that my app recieved it
7. github sends me back the user's data

2 step handshake -- I confirm I talk to github, github confirms not hacked

8. check if user exists -- if so log in
9. otherwise create user based on their email and log them in
## MODELS SHOULD NEVER KNOW ABOUT HTTP OR REQUESTS

## THINK ABOUT "MAIN CHARACTERS" OR MODELS -- as few as possible
